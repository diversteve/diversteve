- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @diversteve
- ðŸ‘€ I left the corporate IT world a few years ago to take a part-time position with my church and to work with an international disaster relief organization (Hope Force International)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently keeping up my skills to help my church and other NGO organizations that I am involved with.
